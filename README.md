## Catching-Letters-Interactive-Game

# Game Description:

Players start with a blank black screen with a red line near the bottom of the
screen. Letters start appearing near the top of the screen, randomly from A
through Z and move downwards. The goal of the game is for the user to last as
long as possible without letting any of the letters hit the red line.
This game can be used as typing practice, as it can increase the users typing
coordination and speed. It forces them to type letters on a keyboard as fast as
possible.

# How to Play:

The game is played with the use of the PS/2 keyboard device. The user is to
type the appropriate keys on this device in order to ‘catch’ the letters while
they are on their way to the red line. If a user types any key and the letter for
that corresponding key is not on the screen at that instance, then nothing will
occur and the letters will keep moving down. When the user ‘catches’ a letter, a
new one will be displayed near the top half of the screen. The game over
screen displays once any letter hits the red line.

The switches on the De1-SoC board have been also used for the games
functionality. Putting SW1 high will result in the game to pause. Putting SW2
high will result in the game being reset. The game will continue to reset at
random as long as SW2 is high. The remaining switches have no use.
An effective game strategy would be to focus on keys in the lower half of the
screen, as typing the letters in the top half will keep creating more near this
region. Another useful strategy is to look for letters that appear more than
once and try to eliminate those in a combination.
